// The whole site is prerenderable (every route is built from the local
// patterns/ folder; interactivity is client-side), so it ships as a pure
// static export. On Cloudflare Workers that means out/ is uploaded as static
// assets and served straight off the network as files, without invoking the
// Worker at all - see wrangler.jsonc, and worker/index.ts for the two paths
// that do reach code.
//
// Consequences handled elsewhere:
//  - Response headers can't come from next.config in export mode; they live in
//    public/_headers, which Next copies to out/ and wrangler reads.
//  - The /_next/image optimizer doesn't exist in export mode, so the marketing
//    images are pre-sized into public/images by scripts/optimize-images.mjs.
//  - `next start` can't serve an export; `npm start` runs `serve out` (and
//    `npm run preview` runs the real Worker over the same folder).

  // a change CI would reject. The file is maintained by hand; see CLAUDE.md.
