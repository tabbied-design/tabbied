// Turning a packaged template into a preview of a generated direction.
//
// The artifact previewed is the *download* - out/downloads/<slug>/index.html,
// the same bytes the Download button hands over. That is deliberate on both
// counts. It is the only version of a template with no framework left in it,
// so its patterns are `[data-pattern]` placeholders the edits engine can
// rewrite and a plain `hydratePatterns()` can mount, where the live
// /template/<slug>/ page mounts its patterns through React and would ignore an
// attribute written from outside. And previewing what is actually downloaded
// is the difference between a preview and a mockup.
//
// Four changes are made to it, and no others:
//
//   1. A <base> so the package's relative styles/ and images/ still resolve
//      once the document is running inside an iframe on another path.
//   2. The bootstrap's esm.sh import is pointed at a same-origin bundle. The
//      pinned CDN import is right for a stranger who unzipped the download
//      years from now and wrong for this site drawing its own preview. The
//      same script keeps the page's `#section` links in the page - see
//      `bootstrap` for why a srcdoc document cannot do that on its own.
//   3. The edits document - a direction's three strings, or a site's full
//      revision - applied by the engine, exactly as an editor would apply it.
//   4. Every relative stylesheet, image and script reference is spelled out
//      as an absolute path under the package. The <base> already resolves
//      them correctly, but Chromium's speculative preload scanner does not
//      honor a <base> in an about:srcdoc document: it fetched each
//      stylesheet and preloaded image against the *page's* URL first
//      (`/studio/results/styles/base.css` - a 404, then `ERR_ABORTED` once
//      the parser caught up and fetched the right one). Nothing broke, and
//      the console filled with errors that looked exactly like a broken
//      preview. Absolute paths give the scanner nothing to guess.
//
// The rest of the page is untouched, which is what makes this honest: every
// section, image and word the download contains is what shows up here.
