/**
 * Fails the build if components/select-pattern-page/galleryThumbnails.ts holds
 * a config for a design that no longer exists.
 *
 * That file is hand-maintained (palettes and densities were tuned by eye), so
 * nothing regenerates it and a stale entry is invisible: the gallery looks it
 * up as `galleryThumbnails[item.slug]`, keyed off the shipped catalog, so an
 * entry whose slug names nothing is simply never read. 278 of them accumulated
 * that way when the catalog moved from `artworks/` to `patterns/` and the
 * configs for the designs dropped in that move were left behind.
 *
 * The batch generators already delete the entries for designs they drop, but
 * only within the gallery-order range each one owns - anything removed outside
 * a generator (a migration, a hand-deleted JSON) rots unnoticed. This is the
 * backstop for that case.
 *
 * The reverse is NOT an error: a design with no entry at all falls back to its
 * own palette and option defaults, which is how most of the catalog renders.
