// Packages a template site as a downloadable, framework-free HTML template.
//
// The static export is the source of truth: `next build` already renders every
// template page to complete HTML, so a template is derived from that rather
// than hand-ported. A hand-port is four artifacts per site to keep in step,
// and within two edits the download and the live site disagree - which is why
// this whole file reads out/ instead of any source tree (see the
// "Downloadable templates" section of CLAUDE.md).
//
// What comes out is a folder somebody can open from the filesystem and edit:
//
//   werkraum/
//     index.html          the export, minus the Next runtime, plain class names
//     styles/base.css     the site's global reset, verbatim
//     styles/werkraum.css the page's own stylesheet - the authored source file,
//                         comments and all, NOT the minified build output
//     images/             only the images this page references
//     README.md
//
// The stylesheet is the point worth spelling out. The build emits minified CSS
// with hashed class names (.werkraum-module__N8Ibmq__page), which is unreadable
// in a template. Rather than un-minify and de-hash that, this copies the
// *authored* module file - which is already the clean, commented stylesheet a
// person should be editing - and rewrites the hashed names in the HTML back to
// the plain ones the authored file already uses.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/package-templates.mjs                # every packageable site
//   node scripts/package-templates.mjs werkraum       # one site

The same page as the HTML download, as a Vite + React app.

\`\`\`bash
npm install

\`\`\`

\`\`\`
src/App.tsx              the page - edit this
src/${slug}.module.css${' '.repeat(Math.max(0, 12 - slug.length))} its stylesheet, a CSS module
src/main.tsx             mounts App
public/images/           the photography this page uses
\`\`\`

## The patterns

Blocks of pattern are \`<TabbiedPattern>\` elements from
[tabbied](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabbied) (v${version}), rendered live by
[css-doodle](https://css-doodle.com/) - not images:

\`\`\`tsx
<TabbiedPattern pattern={ortho} palette={['transparent', '#C9C8C1']} fit="grid" />
\`\`\`

Swap \`pattern\` for any of the ${DESIGN_COUNT} designs (see https://tabbied.com), change
\`palette\` to recolor, or set \`seed\` to pin one arrangement.

## Images

The photography is AI-generated and ships with this template.

const README = (slug, name, version, slugs) => `# ${name}

A Tabbied template, packaged as a plain HTML template. No build step, no
framework - open \`index.html\` in a browser and it runs.

\`\`\`
index.html            the page
styles/base.css       global reset
styles/${slug}.css${' '.repeat(Math.max(0, 14 - slug.length))}this page's stylesheet - edit this one
images/               the photography this page uses
\`\`\`

## The patterns are live, not images

The blocks of pattern are generated in the browser by
[css-doodle](https://css-doodle.com/) through
[tabbied](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabbied). Each one is a plain \`<div>\`
that describes itself in \`data-\` attributes:

\`\`\`html
<div data-pattern="${slugs[0]}" data-palette="transparent, #C9C8C1"
     data-fit="grid" data-redraw-interval="5200"></div>
\`\`\`

Change \`data-palette\` to recolor it, \`data-pattern\` to swap the design
(${DESIGN_COUNT} to choose from - see https://tabbied.com), \`data-seed\` to pin a
particular arrangement, or drop \`data-redraw-interval\` to hold it still.
The script at the bottom of \`index.html\` is what brings them to life; remove
it and the patterns disappear.

## Fonts

The page links its webfonts from Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts. Self-host them
if you'd rather not depend on a CDN.

## Images

The photography is AI-generated and ships with this template.
