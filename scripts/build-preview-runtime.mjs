// The pattern runtime Studio's preview shell loads, bundled and same-origin.
//
// Studio previews a *generated* direction by taking the packaged download for
// its template, applying an edits document to it, and showing the result. The
// download is the right artefact to show - it is framework-free, its patterns
// are `[data-pattern]` placeholders rather than React, and it is literally what
// the Download button hands over - but its own bootstrap imports tabbied from
// esm.sh, pinned, so the shipped zip keeps rendering years from now. That is
// correct for a stranger who unzipped it and wrong for this site, which would
// then depend on a third-party CDN to draw its own preview.
//
// So the shell rewrites that one script tag to import this file instead. It has
// to be a *bundle* rather than a copy of dist/: `tabbied/dist/core/register.js`
// does a bare `import 'css-doodle'`, which no browser resolves.
//
// The bundle carries the whole catalog, not just the designs the packaged
// templates mount. It used to be derived from the packaged HTML (231 of the
// 338), which was exactly right while a preview could only re-colour a field;
// the customizer's "Shuffle patterns" swaps a field to any design in the
// library, and a design missing from this bundle hydrates to a blank with a
// console warning - the silent failure the whole editable scheme exists to
// avoid. The packaged HTML is still read, as the check that the packager wrote
// something this runtime can draw, and the catalog it is checked against is
// the one the customizer offers.
