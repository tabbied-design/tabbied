// K. Overlap - two shapes crossing, and what the crossing does.
//
// A pair of shapes, and the interest is in the third region they make: the
// part where both of them are, which reads as its own color because the upper
// one is let down rather than opaque.
//
// opacity is the property doing the work, and it exports exactly - it becomes
// a group attribute. What is deliberately *not* here is mix-blend-mode: it
// exports as an SVG blend style, the least portable thing the converter emits,
// and it carries a caveat in the catalog.
