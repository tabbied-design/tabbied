// C. Sector - hard-stop conic pies.
//
// conic-gradient is the only thing in CSS that sweeps a value round an angle,
// and it is also the one gradient SVG has no primitive for. The distinction
// that matters is *hard stop* versus sweep: a span whose two ends are the same
// color is a sector, and the converter emits it as a path; a span whose ends
// differ is a smooth angular blend, and the converter refuses it. Four designs
// in the catalog are marked "no SVG export" for exactly that reason.
//
// Every conic here is a hard stop, used as a mask, so the part that is not the
// sector is a genuine hole rather than a fill in the background color. What
// separates one design from the next is where the apex sits, how wide the
// sector opens, how many of them there are, and whether the middle is bored
// out.
