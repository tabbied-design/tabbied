// Rendering gate for batch 13: every design paints, keeps its cells across a
// reseed (so transitions animate), re-inks on that reseed, renders identically
// on a transparent background, and logs no console errors. The harness lives
// in render-sweep.mjs, shared with batches 11 and 12; this script points it at
// batch 13.
//
// The transparent-background pass matters here the way it did in batch 12:
// this batch cuts every void with a mask or a clip, and a void is only a real
// hole if nothing behind it is painted in the background color. Contact
// sheets land in /tmp/sheet-b13-*.png, the transparent pass over a
// checkerboard so a cut that is genuinely see-through looks it.
//
// validate-svg-batch13.mjs is the export half of the same gate.
// Set CHROMIUM_PATH to use a browser other than Playwright's own download, and
// ONLY=slug,slug to narrow the run while authoring.
