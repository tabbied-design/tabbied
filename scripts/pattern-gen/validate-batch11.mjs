// Rendering gate for batch 11: every design paints, keeps its cells across a
// reseed (so transitions animate), re-inks on that reseed, renders identically
// on a transparent background, and logs no console errors. The harness is
// render-sweep.mjs; validate-svg-batch11.mjs is the export half of the gate.
//
// Contact sheets land in /tmp/sheet-b11-*.png. Set CHROMIUM_PATH to use a
// browser other than Playwright's own download, and ONLY=slug,slug to narrow
// the run while authoring.
