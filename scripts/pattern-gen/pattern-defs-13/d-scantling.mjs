// D. Scantling - the two halves of a rebated joint.
//
// One block with a step plowed out of its corner, and the block that step
// was cut to receive. They are the same carpentry read from either side, and
// putting them next to each other in a grid is the point: at any frequency
// the field mixes both halves, so the cells look like timber waiting to be
// fitted rather than one shape repeated.
//
// Both are a single clip-path polygon over one ink. The notch is cut, never
// filled, so it stays open on a transparent background.
