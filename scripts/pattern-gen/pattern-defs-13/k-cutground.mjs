// K. Cutground - ground stepped and notched, all clip-path.
//
// A solid sheet with a profile taken out of it: one bench cut into a sheer
// face, and the two notches a river wears - a wide V, and the near-vertical
// slot it deepens into. Each is a single polygon, and the cut runs right to
// the edge of the cell so neighboring cells read as continuous ground rather
// than as a row of separate marks.
//
// Nothing is filled back in behind the notch. On a transparent background the
// cut is genuinely see-through, which is the whole reason these are clipped
// rather than drawn as two abutting shapes.
