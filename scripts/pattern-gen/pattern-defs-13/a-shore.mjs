// A. Shore - land held against an edge, and the water that shapes it.
//
// Every design starts from a slab of ground pushed up against one side of the
// cell and asks what the sea does to it: bites a bay out of its seaward edge,
// parts around an islet, leaves a bar lying offshore, or faces a second shore
// across open water. Everything is a hard-stop radial or linear layer used as
// a mask over one ink, so the water is a real hole - set the background slot
// to transparent and the sheet shows through every inlet.
//
// `farthest-side` radials are what keep the geometry honest at the edge: a
// stop at 100% means "one cell side" wherever the center sits, where the
// default `farthest-corner` would quietly rescale as the center moved.
