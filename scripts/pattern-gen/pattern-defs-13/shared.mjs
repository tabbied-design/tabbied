// Batch 13 - shared vocabulary.
//
// Batch 13 inherits the constraint batches 11 and 12 established: every design
// must export as native SVG with *no* caveat - no `svgExport: false`, no
// `svgExportNote`, no converter warning, and pixel parity with the live render
// well inside the house budget. pattern-defs-11/shared.mjs is where the
// vocabulary that satisfies it was worked out, pattern-defs-12/shared.mjs is
// where the smooth ramps were added, and this module re-exports what this
// batch actually uses rather than restating any of it.
//
// What is off the table is unchanged: box-shadow, filter: blur(),
// mix-blend-mode (all export as SVG *filters*, which design tools import
// imperfectly), repeating-conic-gradient and smooth conic sweeps (SVG has no
// angular gradient), nested @doodle() images and @svg() payloads (documented
// sub-pixel deviations from the live render), and borders on partially-rounded
// boxes (the converter throws).
//
// Where batch 13 goes further is *placement*: batches 11 and 12 drew almost
// everything from the middle of the cell out, and this batch anchors its
// geometry to the cell's corners and edges instead - a shore held against one
// side, a frame hugging the perimeter, a light thrown in from an edge. The
// helpers below exist for that: `farthest-side` radials so a stop at 100%
// means "one cell side" wherever the center sits, and hard linear bands that
// read as bars without needing a pseudo-element.
//
// The house rules inherited from batches 6-12 still apply and are enforced by
// generate-batch13.mjs: exactly one @random(${shapeFrequency}) gate per
// design; every design samples a transition-able ink per cell so a reseed
// morphs; a randomized custom prop read more than once goes through @var(--x);
// nothing paints var(--color0).
