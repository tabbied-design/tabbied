// F. Metalwork - beads turned concentric on the lathe.
//
// A repeating-radial-gradient run from the center of the cell: fine rings all
// the way out, every one the same weight. The first stop has to sit at 0 or
// the repeat starts mid-ring and the center reads as a blot.
//
// The converter maps these to <radialGradient> stops one for one, which is
// why rings land at a flat 0.00% against their live render: there is no
// geometry for a vector renderer to re-derive, only stops. And because the
// rings are a mask rather than a two-color image, the ground between them
// stays see-through.
