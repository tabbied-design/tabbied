// P. Woolwork - a periodic field crossed with a smooth ramp.
//
// `mask-composite: intersect` multiplies two mask layers: the field decides
// where ink *can* go, the ramp decides how much of it survives. What comes out
// is a halftone that lives in a band - rules that exist only across the middle
// of the cell, dots given a luster on the bias - and neither layer could draw
// it alone.
//
// The intersection exports as one <mask> nested inside the next, which is the
// correct reading of what CSS did, and the field itself becomes an SVG
// <pattern> holding a single tile however dense it gets.
