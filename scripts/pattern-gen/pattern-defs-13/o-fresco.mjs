// O. Fresco - the fall of ink quantized into counted levels.
//
// `stepFade()` writes a linear fall as flat translucent levels; `stepGlow()`
// does the same on a circle. Every stop pair sits at the same position, so
// both are hard-stop gradients that *read* as ramps - the levels come from the
// alpha, not from interpolation - and the section works them the way a fresco
// is worked: a day's plaster at a time.
//
// The alpha is carried by the mask, not by the ink, so the levels stay real
// holes: on a transparent background the sheet shows through each step in
// proportion rather than through none of them.
