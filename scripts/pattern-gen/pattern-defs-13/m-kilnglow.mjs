// M. Kilnglow - a smooth radial ramp, behaving like a glaze.
//
// A scorch reaching in from one corner: solid for a fifth of its radius, then
// a long smooth fall to nothing. It is the effect a blur or a box-shadow would
// normally be reached for, and it is here written as stops instead - which is
// the entire reason it can ship in this batch. The catalog already carries
// four caveated designs (bokeh, neon, lantern, terrain) that reach for a
// filter to do this; a <radialGradient> needs no note at all.
//
// The ramp is a mask over a solid ink, never a two-color background image, so
// a reseed morphs through the color and the faded end is a real hole with a
// soft edge rather than a blend into whatever happens to be behind it. The
// converter subdivides the color->transparent run because CSS interpolates
// premultiplied alpha where SVG does not.
