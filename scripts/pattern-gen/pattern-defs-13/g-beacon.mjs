// G. Beacon - two fans of light thrown from opposite edges.
//
// A hard-stop conic sector is the one angular form the converter can carry:
// SVG has no angular gradient, so a sector whose color changes anywhere but
// at a shared stop angle is banned outright, and the lints hold this section
// to that. Two sectors aimed at each other from facing edges leave a gap down
// the middle that belongs to neither, which is the whole drawing.
//
// The sectors are mask layers over one ink, so the dark between the beams is
// a real hole rather than a second color standing in for one.
