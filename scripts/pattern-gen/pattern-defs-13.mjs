// Batch 13 - 42 designs that export as native SVG with no caveat at all.
//
// Batches 11 and 12 fixed the *format*: designs that download as true vector
// files with no warning dialog, no filter effects for a design tool to mangle,
// and no sub-pixel deviation from what is on screen. This batch keeps that
// rule and changes the *anchor*: where those batches drew almost everything
// from the middle of the cell outward, this one seats its geometry against the
// cell's corners and edges - a shoreline held against one side, a frame
// hugging the perimeter, a light thrown in from an edge, a notch cut right
// through to the border.
//
// That anchoring is what the new vocabulary in pattern-defs-13/shared.mjs is
// for: `farthest-side` radials, so a stop at 100% means "one cell side"
// wherever the center sits, and hard linear bands, so a bar is a mask layer
// that composes rather than a pseudo-element that does not.
//
// Sixteen families, in the order they ship:
//
//   A. Shore      land held against an edge, and the water shaping it.  (5)
//   B. Fell       a rounded mass standing off the side.                 (1)
//   C. Roofline   profiles taken off the top of a solid mass.           (2)
//   D. Scantling  the two halves of a rebated joint.                    (2)
//   E. Shirting   one stripe, four weights.                             (4)
//   F. Metalwork  beads turned concentric on the lathe.                 (1)
//   G. Beacon     two fans of light thrown from opposite edges.         (1)
//   H. Sheer      the dotted grounds of net and lace.                   (4)
//   I. Rigging    spars run out on the diagonal.                        (2)
//   J. Casement   frames, and the openings cut through them.            (5)
//   K. Cutground  ground stepped and notched, all clip-path.            (3)
//   L. Knitwork   ribbing end-on, and a sawtooth skyline.               (2)
//   M. Kilnglow   a smooth radial ramp, behaving like a glaze.          (1)
//   N. Silk       linear ramps as sheen on cloth.                       (3)
//   O. Fresco     the fall of ink quantized into counted levels.        (4)
//   P. Woolwork   a periodic field crossed with a smooth ramp.          (2)
//
// House rules, inherited from every earlier batch and enforced by
// generate-batch13.mjs (via pattern-lints.mjs) and validate-batch13.mjs /
// validate-svg-batch13.mjs: exactly one @random(${shapeFrequency}) gate per
// design; every design samples a transition-able ink per cell so a reseed
// morphs; a randomized custom prop read more than once goes through @var(--x);
// nothing paints var(--color0), because a hole knocked out in the background
// color stops being a hole the moment the background is transparent.
