// L. Ring - hard-stop radial bands.
//
// A radial-gradient whose stops all land on the same position is a set of
// concentric hard edges: transparent to the first radius, ink between two, and
// transparent again past the second. Used as a mask that is a real ring with a
// real hole in it - set the background slot to transparent and the sheet shows
// through the middle.
//
// The converter maps these to <radialGradient> stops one for one, which is why
// rings land at a flat 0.00% against their live render: there is no geometry
// for a vector renderer to re-derive, only stops.
