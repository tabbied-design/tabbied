// G. Rampband - a ramp cut into steps.
//
// `stepFade()` writes a fall as a handful of flat translucent levels, every
// stop pair sitting at the same position. It is a hard-stop gradient that
// reads as a ramp, and it is the one place in the batch where the *amount* of
// ink is quantized rather than the geometry - the cell goes down in counted
// stages instead of sliding.
//
// The alpha is carried by the mask, not by the ink, so the levels stay real
// holes: on a transparent background the sheet shows through each step in
// proportion.
