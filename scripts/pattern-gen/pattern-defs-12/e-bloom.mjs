// E. Bloom - the ramp run outwards from a point instead of across the cell.
//
// A radial-gradient mask is a glow with none of the machinery of one: no
// blur, no shadow, no filter - just stops on a circle. That matters here more
// than anywhere else in the batch, because a glow is exactly the effect the
// catalog already had four caveated designs for (`bokeh`, `neon`, `lantern`,
// `terrain` all reach for box-shadow or blur and all carry an svgExportNote).
// Written as stops it exports as a <radialGradient> and needs no note at all.
//
// The light here is thrown from a corner rather than the middle, so each cell
// catches a different part of the falloff as the quarter turn moves the source
// around.
