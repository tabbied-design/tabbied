// Batch 12 - shared vocabulary.
//
// Batch 12 inherits batch 11's constraint wholesale: every design must export
// as native SVG with *no* caveat - no `svgExport: false`, no `svgExportNote`,
// no converter warning, and pixel parity with the live render well inside the
// house budget. docs/svg-export.md is the contract; pattern-defs-11/shared.mjs
// is where the vocabulary that satisfies it was worked out, and this module
// re-exports it rather than restating it.
//
// What is off the table is unchanged and worth repeating, because it is the
// whole reason both batches look the way they do: box-shadow, filter: blur(),
// mix-blend-mode (all export as SVG *filters*, which design tools import
// imperfectly), repeating-conic-gradient and smooth conic sweeps (SVG has no
// angular gradient), nested @doodle() images and @svg() payloads (documented
// sub-pixel deviations from the live render), and borders on partially-rounded
// boxes (the converter throws).
//
// Where batch 12 goes further is the other direction: *smooth* gradients.
// Batch 11 had one section of them (M. Fade, nine designs) and used hard stops
// everywhere else. Most of this batch is built on the smooth ramp - linear and
// radial, always as masks - because that is the part of the supported subset
// the catalog had barely touched, and because a <linearGradient> or
// <radialGradient> with the same stops is about the most faithful thing the
// converter emits. Nineteen of the thirty-two designs are those; the other
// thirteen work in the hard-edged vocabulary.
//
// Two things make a smooth ramp safe here where a conic one is not:
//
//   * a linear or radial gradient maps stop-for-stop onto its SVG equivalent,
//     including the premultiplied-alpha subdivision the converter does for a
//     color->transparent run (CSS interpolates premultiplied, SVG does not);
//   * the ramp is a *mask* over a solid ink, never a two-color background
//     image. That keeps the ink an ordinary background-color, so a reseed
//     morphs through the color instead of snapping to it, and it makes the
//     faded end a real hole - set the background slot to transparent and the
//     sheet shows through the soft edge exactly as it does through a hard one.
//
// The house rules inherited from batches 6-11 still apply and are enforced by
// generate-batch12.mjs: exactly one @random(${shapeFrequency}) gate per design;
// every design samples a transition-able ink per cell; a randomized custom
// property read more than once goes through @var(--x); nothing paints
// var(--color0).
