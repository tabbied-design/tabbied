// Batch 11 - 55 designs that export as native SVG with no caveat at all.
//
// The earlier batches were organized around a motif: batch 9 asked what
// happens when the canvas is the unit rather than the cell, batch 10 built
// drawings larger than the cell they start in. This one is organized around a
// *format*. Native SVG export shipped with three tiers - four designs it
// cannot represent, eighteen it exports with a caveat the user has to be shown
// first, and the rest clean - and this batch is 55 more of the clean tier.
// Every design here downloads as a true vector file with no warning dialog, no
// filter effects for a design tool to mangle, and no sub-pixel deviation from
// what is on screen.
//
// That is a real constraint, not a label. Ruled out: box-shadow, blur, blend
// modes (all export as SVG filters), smooth conic sweeps and
// repeating-conic-gradient (no SVG primitive), nested @doodle() images and
// @svg() payloads (documented sub-pixel deviations), and borders on
// partially-rounded boxes (the converter throws). What is left - solid fills,
// radii, clip paths, every linear and radial gradient, masks including
// mask-composite: intersect, hard-stop conic sectors, transforms, opacity,
// z-index - is the vocabulary of the whole batch. See
// pattern-defs-11/shared.mjs for the reasoning and the helpers, and
// docs/svg-export.md for the export contract itself.
//
// The twelve families, in the order they ship:
//
//   A. Split       one straight cut across the cell; two inks meet.        (6)
//   B. Rule        stripe fields - pitch, duty, angle.                     (3)
//   C. Sector      hard-stop conic pies.                                   (2)
//   D. Annulus     radial hard stops: rings and bands.                     (4)
//   E. Chamfer     polygons that cut corners, notches and steps.          (14)
//   F. Lobe        border-radius forms.                                    (2)
//   H. Bar         placed bars rather than repeating fields.               (2)
//   I. Wedge       triangles.                                              (2)
//   J. Speck       dot fields and halftones.                               (7)
//   K. Overlap     two shapes crossing, read through opacity.              (1)
//   L. Intersect   mask-composite: intersect - one shape cut by another.   (3)
//   M. Fade        smooth linear ramps, used as masks.                     (9)
//
// (The letters are the families the batch was drawn from; G, N, O and P were
// authored and cut, so the sequence skips them rather than renumbering
// designs that already have their gallery order.)
//
// House rules, inherited from every earlier batch and enforced by
// generate-batch11.mjs and validate-batch11.mjs: exactly one
// @random(${shapeFrequency}) gate per design; every design samples a
// transition-able ink per cell so a reseed morphs; a randomized custom prop
// read more than once goes through @var(--x); nothing paints var(--color0),
// because a hole knocked out in the background color stops being a hole the
// moment the background is transparent.
