export const INSTRUCTIONS = `Tabbied is a catalog of generative patterns (css-doodle) usable as backgrounds, textures, posters, and exported SVG/PNG assets.

Designs are addressed by slug, and slugs are opaque - "cleat", "karst", "radius" say nothing about what they look like. Never guess one: call search_designs, which filters on a closed vocabulary of motifs, moods, density, and intended use.

Metadata narrows the field; it does not settle it. These are pictures, so call preview_design on your shortlist and look before you commit. Choosing off tags alone is the main way this goes wrong.

When you write integration code, remember a pattern has no intrinsic size: it fills its parent and collapses to nothing in a parent that sizes to content. Pass height or aspectRatio unless the parent is definitely sized. get_docs has the full API contract and recipes.`;
